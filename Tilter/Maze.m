//  This file creates a graph of the correct dimensions, when it is created it has no walls, it is simply a plane in which an
//  object can move. The walls to be removed are then retrieved and the objects in the graph array are removed to create areas
//  in which the character cannot move.
//
//  The idea behind this file and the process of creating the maze in this way has come from an example application in the
//  apple developer documentation, which is avaliable at:
//  https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/Pathfinder_GameplayKit/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016461
