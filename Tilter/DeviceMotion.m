//  This class deals with the interface between the applicaton and the gyroscope, the attitude of the device represents an
//  orientation with respect to a given state, rather than returning the rate of rotation.
//
//  Inspiration for this file has come from a tutorial avaliable at https://wwwbruegge.in.tum.de/lehrstuhl_1/home/98-teaching/tutorials/505-sgd-ws13-tutorial-core-motion
//  It is therefore possible that this file will bare some similarity to the example project given on this page.
